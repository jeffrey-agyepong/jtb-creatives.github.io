              <h3 class="center">Graphic Designer</h3>
              <p>
                Graphic Designers are creative problem solvers. You are in
                charge of creating stylish, eye-catching, and memorable logos,
                packagings, posters, magazine pages; or even an entire brand's
                identity!
              </p>
              <p>
                A graphic designer’s duties involve developing logos,
                illustrations and designs, creating designs according to design
                briefs and presenting said designs and design ideas to clients
                and directors. Graphic designers may also work in a team with
                copywriters and creative directors to develop a final design and
                to ensure the final design is visually appealing and achieves
                its intended purpose
              </p>
              <p>
                To successfully fulfill their duties, graphic designers possess
                technical skills such as a firm grasp on design principles,
                ideation, branding, typography, designing for print, UI/UX, and
                design technologies. Designers also possess abstract skills such
                as creativity, communication, forming strategies, problem
                solving, and time management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Graphic designers are usually employed in three environments. As
                an in-house graphic designer, an agency graphic designer, or a
                freelance graphic designer
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In-House designers work for a single company, in a team of
                  designers or solo, and creating design solutions specific for
                  the company, such as copyrighted products, magazines and
                  brochures, or the company itself's brandings and logos
                </li>
                <li>
                  Agency designers work for design agencies who accept design
                  jobs from a vast assortment of companies and entities.
                  Designers may be assigned jobs according to their specialties
                  and skillsets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Freelance designers are self-employed. They essentially run
                  their own business, and are solely responsible for marketing,
                  client relations, and finding work. They are also responsible
                  for accounting tasks. In exchange for the extra
                  responsibilities, freelance designers enjoy vastly more
                  freedom in how they tackle their work.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A graphic designer’s day begins by considering their daily
                schedule. If a designer is employed in a company or an agency,
                they may need to report daily and report their schedule.
                Designers may then need to meet with clients to work out a
                design brief or revisions to ensure complete understanding.
                Afterwards, the designer develops concepts and drafts. Then, the
                designer may spend the rest of the workday creating the design.

                Marketers also conduct market research, and as such must be
                proficient in data analysis and tools. Marketers may also need

                may need to communicate with clients regarding job details, or

                their marketing strategies. Afterwards, they may then start
                designing marketing materials.

              <h3 class="center">Creative Director</h3>
              <p>
                Creative Directors are the creative heads of their firm,
                department, or agency. The goal of a creative director is to
                supervise a team’s creative process, from the conception and
                client ideas to the final look and feel of the product. This is
                not an entry-level job as it is multidisciplinary, but rather a
                position that one can get into around 8-10 years later down the
                line. Foundationally, many creative directors start their
                careers as graphic designers and work their way up to this role.
              </p>
              <p>
                The day-to-day of a creative director involves managing
                deadlines, lead the creative process according to the vision of
                the client, and having business meetings with the stakeholders
                of that project.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be a creative director, one must have a background in art and
                design in order to inform their creative decisions, as well as
                communication and business skills in order to attract and
                maintain clients and manage their staff. They must also be up to
                date with news and design trends in order to keep their work
                relevant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creative Directors are the heads of any creative team, so their
                place of employment can vary. They can lead the team at, for
                example, a film studio, publication firm (such as newspapers or
                magazines), or advertising agencies.
              </p>
